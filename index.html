            <!-- Cats are a very common household pet. They cannot stay cooped up in one room, and ideally need roam of the house or outside.
            Cat need a litter box (changed daily). If you want mulitiple cats you need one per cat with one extra. Cats enjoy scratching posts
            and high places. Please note that cats can have mild destruction on home when it comes to their claws and fur. They are very loving 
            but also independent animals, so you won't have to worry about them at work if you have a busy schedule. -->

        <h5>Small Dog</h5>
        <p>Small dogs can stay indoors or outdoors. They need regular exercise and do not cause much home destruction. They need attention 
            and playtime though, so before adopting one you have sufficent time to spend with it daily. Small dogs really enjoy little play toys
            you can leave around your home for them to play with. They are not a high maintenance pet. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Large Dog</h5>
        <p>
            Large dogs are about the same with medium dogs when it comes to care. They can also live indoors or outdoors, however, it is
            best for them be in a large outside area. You really need a lot of time spend with them and depending on the breed, you may have to
            pamper their fur coats if thick and needs brushing to shed for summer time. They also need daily exercise! A long walk should be great for them
            and you as well, as you get to know your new family member.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Small Pet</h5>
        <p>
            Small Pets can include hermit crabs, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, snails, you name it! These include animals that can live in 
            a big enough cage for their size and stay (mostly) in one room. These are very much beginner and low maintenance pets. They do not
            require much attention or maintenance if you have a more busy life style. However they can not be shunned and still need their living
            environments to be cleaned and have enough attention from owners. Please do appropriate research on the specific small pet you would like 
            to take into your new home.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Small Bird</h5>
        <p>
            Small birds are mostly low maintenance pets, however they do need to have attention daily and cage cleaned. Ideally you should let them out of 
            their enclosure daily as well to spend more time with you. You should have many gadgets and toys for your new small bird to play with
            in their cage and in your home. They are very social animals, so it would be a good idea to think about purchasing a second small bird to keep
            the other company.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Large Bird</h5>
        <p>
            Large birds are considered high maintenance pets. They are extremely social animals, so they require a great deal of attention and play time.
            These pets are not ideal for people who have a busy day to day life, and require many hours of attention from owners. Ideally the only
            time they should be left in their cage is when it is time for them to sleep. Some large birds can also be destructive on the home. many like to 
            chew and snap anything they get ahold of in the home, or just make a mess in general. These are not beginner pets by any means.
            They are high cost high reward though! Having a large
            bird can be very comforting and are amazing pets! Some you can even teach to speak word to you or sing, and dance!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Reptile</h5>
        <p>
            Reptiles are considered low to medium maintenance pets. They do not require a great deal of attention, and most of them can stay in their
            enclosures. They might require more money upfront, but the maintenance fees annually are very low. They need a UVB light and heating lamp
            in their enclosure to simulate daylight for their bones to grow propperly and to stay warm. They also need thier tanks cleaned at least 
            weekly.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Amphibian</h5>
        <p>
            Amphibians are considered a mostly low maintenance pet. They shouldn't be handled too often. If you do handle them, make sure your hands 
            are clean and also wet so that you don’t make them sick or hurt their skin. They will also need their enclosure cleaned regularly.
             They will most likely need a moist encolsure, so be sure to do extensive research on the pet you wish to get before committing.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Fish</h5>
        <p>
            Fish are one of the most low maintenance pets you can get, and are often reffered to as a 'beginners pet'. They do not require
            attention from you, but you still have to do weekly water changes to you tank and treat it with the right chemicals, so your fish doesn't die.
            There are many different types of fish, and you will have to do research on the specific kind you want. Some require a water heater and must maintain
            the water to be that tempurature. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Pig</h5>
        <p>
            Pigs are a lot cleaner than their popular reputation indicates and they can make super pets. They are sociable and intelligent,
             and can become very obedient, but they are also curious, stubborn, and — if treated poorly — potentially dangerous. Indoor pigs 
            can be house trained and leash trained like dogs, but they have unique care requirements that you should be prepared for. If outside,
            make sure your pig has a big open fenced in area to roam. Pigs need to exercise and have attenton daily.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Ferret</h5>
        <p>
                Ferrets are popular pets due to their friendly and outgoing personalities. Curious by nature, a ferret can provide hours of 
                entertainment for their owner. However, they require a great deal of care and attention. To keep a ferret as a pet, you’ll need 
                to create a proper cage environment with a litter box, food and water bowls, and toys. They are generally low maintenance pets, 
                but still need attention and propper care. Please note they are escape artists, so make sure your home has no way outside before
                letting them run around in the home.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Goat</h5>
        <p>
                Goats are smart, curious pets that are fun to have around. However, they can also be hard work. If not cared for properly, they 
                can get aggressive and may try to escape to greener pastures -- literally. Luckily, you can make your goat a happy family member 
                by creating a safe home for them, feeding them properly, grooming them, and keeping them healthy.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Horse</h5>
        <p>
                A horse is a big time commitment. They can cost anywhere from $300 to $800 a month and they can live for 30 years or more.
                They are very much high maintenance pets and requre a lot money, outdoors space, and time! 
                Still, horses are great companions and highly enjoyable, so make sure you're housing and feeding them properly and giving them 
                the right care.
